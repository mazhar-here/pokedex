# Pokedex

A React based Pokedex which covers the 1st and 2nd generation of Pokemon. It uses the REST PokeApi to fetch the pokemon data and 
uses React-Bootstrap for responsive design. Custom CSS is also used where required. I used to play Pokemon a lot as a kid, so
as I was revisiting/replaying Pokemon Crystal, I thought it would be really fun to create a Pokedex web app along with it.
